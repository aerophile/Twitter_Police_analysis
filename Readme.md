## Police Twitter Analysis Web App

## To run
0. Rename SAMPLE_api_keys.py to api_keys.py and add your own keys in the appropriate fields. The web app can be run without this step but then data would not be refreshed.
1. Initialise a Virtualenv Venv and activate it.
2. install dependencies as mentioned in the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
3. execute __init__.py from the directory ps17_shubham_gupta/. So the command would look like
`$python Flaskapp/__init.py`
4. the web app should now be available on [local server](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
