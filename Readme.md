0. Rename SAMPLE_api_keys.py to api_keys.py and add your own keys in the appropriate fields. The web app can be run without this step but then data would not be refreshed.
1. Initialise Virtualenv Venv
2. install dependencies as mentioned in the requirements
3. execute __init__.py from the directory ps17_shubham_gupta/. So the command would look like
`$python Flaskapp/__init.py`
